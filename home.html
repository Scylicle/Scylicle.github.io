    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">I would find myself as a calm, collective person. I can get active in certain situation, but overall, I am, me. While I do have some hobbies such as being a agricultural salesman, or night rides or walks, a certain hobby that catches my feelings and emotions best is photography.</p>
    <p class="text_column">It began with me taking standard photos from trips or experiences I had in my life. It would come out simple and nice. As time went on, during 8th grade, I took my first photo that had my eye. It was a gas station that I took on my bus with a dark type of feeling and mood. I edited it so the lights reflected from the glass appeared as stars, and with that began my journey.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Today, I still put effort into my photos and take them depending on the mood that area gives me, and what I am feeling in general. Even though others say the photos are good, I want to break through my limits, and try to always improve on my skills of photography. It may as well still be a start as of now, but that's okay. I will always find new ways to improve and to achieve new limits for photography.</p>

      <h3>Night Rides</h3>
      <p>Night rides or night walks really sooth my feelings and help me calm down. Being in stressful situations and going on a walk or ride helps me calm down, as if I was walking or driving away from my problems. Now I still resolve those problems, but I at least try to get a breather before I dive in. </p>

      <h3>AGRICULTURAL SALESMAN</h3>
      <p>For 8 months, I took care of my pig name Chris. P. Bacon. he took me on one hell of a journey. The cool fall, the freezing winter, and the humid summer all were with him last year, and I took him to auction and he got sold. I am just summarizing what happened and not going to tell all the experiences I had with him, that'll be way too much, but it was fun trying out agriculure, and hopefully, I can return someday. </p>
